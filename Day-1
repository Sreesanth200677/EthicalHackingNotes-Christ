Cybersecurity Class – Day 1 Report
Date: 15/07/2025

Topics Covered
1. Types of Hackers:

White Hat: Ethical hackers who help organizations identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

Black Hat: Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal or financial gain.

Gray Hat: Individuals who may break rules but typically without malicious intent.

Green Hat: Newcomers who are passionate about learning hacking techniques.

Blue Hat: Individuals who hack out of revenge or those involved in pre-release software testing.

Script Kiddies: Inexperienced users who rely on pre-made tools rather than their own skills.

2. Phases of Hacking:

Reconnaissance: Gathering preliminary information about the target.

Scanning: Identifying open ports, active services, and vulnerabilities.

Gaining Access: Exploiting weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.

Maintaining Access: Establishing backdoors to retain control over the system.

Clearing Tracks: Removing evidence to avoid detection and maintain anonymity.

3. Types of Cyber Threats:

Malware (e.g., viruses, worms, trojans)

Ransomware – Encrypts data and demands payment.

Spyware & Adware – Covert tracking and unwanted advertisements.

Social Engineering – Psychological manipulation to extract confidential information.

Insider Threats – Threats from individuals within the organization.

Zero-Day Exploits – Attacks targeting unpatched vulnerabilities.

4. Common Hacking Techniques:

Phishing: Deceptive attempts to steal sensitive data.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): Intercepting communication between parties.

Keylogging: Capturing keystrokes to obtain user credentials.

Brute Force Attacks: Systematic guessing of passwords.

Session Hijacking: Taking over a user’s session to gain unauthorized access.

SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL code to manipulate databases.

5. Cybersecurity Teams and Roles:

Red Team: Offensive security experts who simulate real-world attacks.

Blue Team: Defensive team responsible for protecting systems and responding to incidents.

Purple Team: Facilitates collaboration between red and blue teams to improve overall security.

(Optional if covered) Yellow/Green Teams: Involved in secure coding and DevSecOps processes.

Additional Key Concepts:
CIA Triad: Core principles of cybersecurity – Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Popular Tools: Introduction to Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, etc.

Security Best Practices: Emphasis on strong password policies and two-factor authentication (2FA).

Linux Fundamentals: Basic terminal commands and usage.

Virtualization: Overview of virtual machines and tools like Kali Linux.

Legal and Ethical Aspects: Understanding the ethical responsibilities and legal boundaries of hacking.

Reflection:
Today’s session provided a strong foundational understanding of cybersecurity principles. We explored the diverse profiles of hackers, the structured phases of a cyber attack, and various forms of digital threats. The introduction to real-world tools and team roles within cybersecurity operations made the concepts highly relevant and practical. The session effectively balanced theoretical knowledge with insights into hands-on application, paving the way for deeper technical exploration in upcoming classes.
