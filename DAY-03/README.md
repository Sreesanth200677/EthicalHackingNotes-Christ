Cybersecurity Class – Day 3 Report

Date: [Insert today’s date]
Topic: Introduction to Basic Kali Linux Commands
Environment: Kali Linux (VirtualBox on Mac)
Mode: Hands-on Terminal Practice

⸻

What We Did Today

Today’s session focused on getting familiar with the Kali Linux terminal. We explored several basic commands that are essential for navigating the system, managing files and directories, and gathering system information.

This session was mostly hands-on, where we typed each command in the Kali terminal and observed its output to understand its purpose.

Commands We Practiced

Below are the commands we used during the class along with a short explanation:

Command	Description
pwd	Shows the current working directory.
ls	Lists files and directories.
cd <directory>	Changes to the specified directory.
mkdir <foldername>	Creates a new directory.
touch <filename>	Creates a new, empty file.
cat <filename>	Displays the contents of a file.
rm <filename>	Deletes a file.
rmdir <foldername>	Deletes an empty directory.
clear	Clears the terminal screen.
whoami	Shows the currently logged-in user.
uname -a	Displays detailed system information.
ifconfig	Shows network interface information.
history	Lists all previously executed commands in the session.

Key Takeaways
	•	Using the terminal may seem difficult at first, but it becomes much easier with practice.
	•	Basic navigation and file management through CLI is a core skill in Linux-based cybersecurity environments.
	•	Understanding what each command does is more important than memorizing everything at once.
	•	Most commands follow simple, logical structures and can be modified with options and arguments.

Looking Ahead

In the next class, we are expected to explore file permissions and ownership using commands like chmod, chown, and ls -l. We may also begin looking into basic network utilities and how to redirect output in the terminal.
